# üöÄ Proxmox Home Lab Setup and Troubleshooting Guide  

## üõ†Ô∏è The Problem  
When setting up Proxmox on my Dell 5450, I encountered multiple networking issues while trying to access the web interface. Additionally, my ASUS Zephyrus laptop does not have a built-in Ethernet port, so I had to connect the Dell 5450 through an Ethernet cable plugged into my USB-C dock. Initially, the connection wasn‚Äôt established, and I couldn‚Äôt reach the Proxmox web interface.

## üîç Investigation and Solution  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ethernet Setup and Dock Issue  
Since my ASUS doesn‚Äôt have an Ethernet port, I used a USB-C dock to connect my Dell 5450 to Ethernet. I assigned static IP addresses to both devices to create a direct connection.  

**Troubleshooting steps:**  
- Verified Ethernet link status on both the Dell 5450 and ASUS.  
- Checked the `/etc/network/interfaces` configuration on the Dell 5450.  
- Ensured that `pveproxy` service was active and port 8006 was listening.  
- Verified the network connectivity using `ping`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Network Configuration  
I edited the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to set up a static IP for the Dell 5450:  

```bash
auto enp0s31f6  
iface enp0s31f6 inet static  
  address 10.0.0.200  
  netmask 255.255.255.0  
  gateway 10.0.0.1  
Then, I restarted the networking service:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl restart networking
3Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying Service Status
I confirmed that the pveproxy service was running and port 8006 was open:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl status pveproxy
netstat -tulnp | grep 8006
4Ô∏è‚É£ Accessing Proxmox Web Interface
Once everything was configured, I opened the Proxmox web interface at https://10.0.0.200:8006. Initially, I received a security warning in the browser due to a self-signed certificate, but after bypassing it, I was able to log in successfully.

‚úÖ Final Outcome
I successfully accessed the Proxmox web interface and completed the setup.

üí° Lessons Learned
Always ensure that your Ethernet connection is functional and properly configured before assigning static IPs.
Verify that necessary services (pveproxy) are running and listening on the correct port.
Using a USB-C dock for Ethernet connection can work, but it may require additional troubleshooting.
üìú Conclusion
This guide summarizes how I configured and troubleshooted my Proxmox setup, overcoming networking issues and successfully accessing the web interface.
