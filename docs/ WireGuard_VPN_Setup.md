Address = 10.10.50.2/24
DNS = 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

[Peer]
PublicKey = <WireGuard Server Public Key>
AllowedIPs = 10.10.50.0/24
Endpoint = <Your Public IP>:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

- Save the configuration as `asus-laptop.conf`.
    

1. **Activate the VPN**
    
    - In the WireGuard client, select the `asus-laptop.conf` tunnel and click **Activate**.

## **Optional: Setting Up DNS for Easy Access**

To avoid remembering IP addresses, set up local DNS in pfSense:

4. Navigate to **Services > DNS Resolver**.
    
5. Add a host override for `proxmox.home.arpa` pointing to `10.10.1.100`.
    
6. Save and apply the changes.
